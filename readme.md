# Azure Pipelines script overview in VS Code

This extension is a small add-on to the official "Azure Pipelines for VS Code" extension by microsoft. More information can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azure-devops.azure-pipelines).

Get this extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=terWoordComputers.azure-pipelines-overview) in the VS Code Market place.

## What does this extension do?

It will present you with an overview of your buildscript as an extra treeview below the OUTLINE panel in the Explorer view.

## It doesn't work

Please make sure the editor sees the file as an `Azure Pipelines` file, instead of a regular `YAML` file. If that's not the case, see the Azure Pipelines extension for more information, or just click the `YAML` button in the lower right corner of VS Code and pick Azure Pipelines.

## This thing is great, but could be better

This is a very quickly developed extension. I'm pretty sure there are area's that can be improved.

For example:
- Extension logo
- More documentation
- More testing
